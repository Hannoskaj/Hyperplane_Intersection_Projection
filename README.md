# Hyperplane intersection projection

Hyperplane intersection projection (HIP) is a very fast algorithm to find a point in the intersection of a convex set and an affine subspace, with a guarantee that the new point is closer than the initial point to any point in the intersection.

Theoretical underpinnings in a forthcoming article.

Code specific to HIP to be added.

Current contents: the folder `PLSPQT_article_code`, which contains the code used in the article
for which HIP was originally developed, namely `Projected Least-Squares Quantum Process Tomography`.

The folder has its own README.
